Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup power trio consisting of bassist/singer Jack Bruce, drummer Ginger Baker, and guitarist/singer Eric Clapton. Their sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock,[1] combining psychedelia-themed lyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's operatic voice and prominent bass playing and Ginger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the world's first platinum-selling double album.[2][3] Cream was widely regarded as being the world's first successful supergroup.[4][5][6][7] In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide.[8] Cream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as "Crossroads" and "Spoonful", and modern blues such as "Born Under a Bad Sign", as well as more eccentric songs such as "Strange Brew", "Tales of Brave Ulysses" and "Toad".
